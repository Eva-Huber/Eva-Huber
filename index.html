												During my time there I tested soils, applied nutrients to the overgrown lot to begin the soil regeneration process, started 
												hundreds of seeds for fall planting, and designed zones 0, 1 and 2 around the property’s house in accordance with permaculture zones.</p>

												and coordinated volunteer efforts to plant trees all around San Diego. This organization opened my eyes to the impact our
