											<p> After completion of my bachelors degree I accepted a job as the director of operations at Bryant Farm and Forest, a permaculture 
												farm in Washington state. Here I oversaw and implemented the seed rotation and planting layout for the 1.5 acre vegetable plot. 
												During my time there I tested soils, applied nutrients to the overgrown lot to begin the soil regeneration process, started 
												hundreds of seeds for fall planting, and designed zones 0, 1 and 2 around the property’s house in accordance with permaculture zones.</p>

												regarding San Diego’s tree coverage for a report on the effect of urban heating in historically disadvantaged communities 
												and coordinated volunteer efforts to plant trees all around San Diego. This organization opened my eyes to the impact our 
												disconnection to nature has on our urban cities and inspired me to dive into agriculture.</p>
