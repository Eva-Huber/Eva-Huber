									<h3><span style="color: hsl(159, 53%, 50%)">Sustainability</span></h3>
									<p>My passion for sustainability is rooted in my own life journey and relationship to the environment. I grew up with my 
										feet in the dirt and my hands in the garden, always trying to grow something new or testing how different crops grew 
										together in my backyard. With the short growing season living in Duluth, MN brings, moving to San Diego shocked me in 
										the possibility of growth and opportunity to learn more about plants and the animals that support them. This led me to 
										dive into policy work, volunteer opportunities and farming that all have increased my knowledge of the natural world, 
										as well as Indigenous practices that care for and regenerate our relationship with the Earth. </p>

												<h4>Data Analyst</h4>
												<p>While working as a data analyst for <a href="https://sustainable.sdsu.edu/">SDSU office of sustainability</a> I was a part of a team that values 
													efficiency, adaptability, and above all else the planet and the people within it. This diverse team 
													upheld high values and professionalism while advocating for the progression of cleaner campus energy 
													and programs. Through analysis I was able to improve and increase accuracy of the universities energy 
													database through monitoring and modifying the existing system, as well as streamlining it into one portfolio 
													management system. This decreased energy bills as well as provided a better understanding of campus energy 
													needs and usage.</p>

													Church, as well as taught peers how to successfully grow their open gardens, even in limited spaces. Seeing students' 
													surprise at how an onion grows reinforced my mission to educate people about where our food comes from. Food insecurity 
													in San Diego has the highest rate in the SDSU region, so combatting this through practical approaches students could take 
													helped to increase student food security and knowledge. </p>

												<h4>Work Experience</h4>
											</div>	
											<p>Since I was 14 years old I have worked in the service industry to support myself financially. This started as making 
												protein shakes, which led to managing the business with supervision of the owner by the time I was 16. I have worked 
												in a couple of different restaurants throughout college in MN and WY. In WY I also worked as a tour guide and a lift 
												operator. I was able to provide customers with an engaging dialogue that was both informative and interesting about the 
												surrounding geographical area. As I have continued my career as a lift operator in CA, I have always ensured safety as 
												well as providing the best service possible in any weather condition, all with a smile and a positive attitude. While 
												leading other lift operators I uphold teamwork and communication as my key values and believe to ensure everyone is doing 
												a good job they must be heard and respected. </p>
											<p>My role in the service industry has provided financial stability throughout college while also teaching me the importance 
												of kindness and respect in any environment to ensure the best experience for my coworkers and guests.</p>

												<h4>Volunteering</h4>
												<p>SInce I was a kid, I have spent many days volunteering in churches, community centers and food banks. I find the 
													time spent in these places some of the most formative experiences I have had, as reminders of the good of people 
													in the communities I live in and of the human nature we all inherent. Whenever I have moved somewhere new, the first 
													thing I look for is a place to volunteer, as I believe this is a great way to engage with your community and give 
													back to people who could use an extra hand, since we all have been at points in our life where a little support 
													makes all the difference. In San Diego I spent time at <a href="http://urban-angels.com/">Urban Angels</a>, and most recently in Tahoe I have been 
													volunteering with <a href="https://sierracommunityhouse.org/">Sierra Community House</a> in their food distribution program. </p>

												<p>I was gifted a camera for Christmas when I was in 8th grade, but it took me until college to appreciate the view through

													find my place in the creative world. Photography led to editing, which led to digital art, which led to selling stickers 
													through Red bubble. I have been lucky to follow my creative energy through the many talents I have found, from drawing to
